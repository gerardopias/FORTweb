			<h3 id="thechallengevulnerabilityofroutingsystems">The challenge: vulnerability of routing systems</h3>

			<p>Routing is one of the few components of Internet infrastructure that remains unsecure. Today, routing
				systems can be easily hijacked to conduct website blocks, eavesdrop on users through snooping and
				redirect traffic to bogus destinations. These vulnerabilities can prevent the free flow of information
				across the globe as well as threaten users’ security and privacy.</p>

			<p>Pakistan’s censorship order to block Youtube in 2008 is perhaps one of the most well-known cases. In an
				attempt to take the site down, Pakistan Telecom falsely claimed to be the correct route for a range of
				YouTube’s IP addresses; soon traffic was directed to the Pakistan ISP, taking YouTube down worldwide for
				over two hours. Similarly, Brazil’s infamous blockage of WhatsApp in 2016, affected users in the entire
				region when wireless phone carriers complying with the court order accidently blocked the app outside of
				Brazil by broadcasting incorrect routing information.</p>

			<p>False route announcements –by accident or design– continue to happen and with frequency. Internet
				Society’s MANRS initiative (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security) reported as many as 13,935 total
				incidents in 2017. Within Latin America and the Caribbean, Brazil led the regional ranking on routing
				incidents with a total of 450 cases, and was second worldwide following the United States, along with
				Russia and India which ranked third and fourth respectively.</p>

			<p>Internet standard developing bodies have long struggled to identify strategies to render routing more
				secure. To date, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been the most successful initiative to
				secure BGP routing, by resorting to the use of signatures as a means to validate the authenticity of IP
				routing information, preventing route hijacks and snooping.</p>

			<p>RPKI deployment however, is still in its earlier stages of development.</p>

			<h3 id="projectobjectives">Project Objectives</h3>

			<p>The goal of the project is to contribute to RPKI deployment as a means to render routing systems –a basic
				building block of Internet infrastructure– more secure and resilient. In turn, the project will
				contribute to the prevention of route hijacks and the exposure of censorship and surveillance attempts
				that rely on vulnerabilities of the routing system.</p>

			<p>The project will work towards three specific objectives:</p>

			<p>Develop a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Validator;
				Conduct a deployment campaign in Latin America and the Caribbean
				Produce a report and develop a tracking tool on Routing Security and Internet Freedom to study routing
				incidents in the region and expose intentional hijacks.</p>

			<p>For RPKI validation to take hold, it is crucial for multiple initiatives to push its implementation
				forward. LACNIC and NIC.MX are currently collaborating to develop a free, open source RPKI Validator
				software. This software will allow operators to validate the BGP routing information against the RPKI
				repository for use in router configuration and resolution. The validator will include a script by which
				the ISPs that deploy the software, will receive periodical notification of failed route announcements.
				While these notifications are not necessary for validation to work, they will serve to generate general
				awareness about the extent of routing incidents and importance of implementing RPKI among operators.</p>

			<p>The only functioning Validator in place is the one developed and maintained by RIPE NCC
				(https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/certification/tools-and-resources,
				https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator), while other efforts have wound down due to lack of funding.
				These include: (a) RPSTIR (Relying Party Security Technology for Internet Routing):
				http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpstir/, https://github.com/bgpsecurity/rpstir; and Dragon Research Labs
				Rcynic validator software, funded by ARIN and the US Department of Homeland Security which is no longer
				active: http://subvert-rpki.hactrn.net/trunk/rcynic/.</p>

			<p>With the requested funds, LACNIC and NIC.MX will continue collaborating to complete the development of
				the validator and will complement this effort with an RPKI deployment campaign in Colombia, Ecuador and
				Costa Rica and through the Academic Network Red Clara which has regional reach. The goal will be to make
				routing infrastructure more secure in the region, as a means to prevent route hijacks which result in
				website blocks and sniffing.</p>

			<p>In addition, the project proposes to produce a report and develop a tracking tool on Routing Security and
				Internet Freedom. The report will document and analyze routing incidents in the region as a means to
				establish a baseline against which to study the evolution of these incidents. In addition, to track
				incidents moving forward, the project team will develop an open access, digital tool which will collect
				data from the LACNIC and RIPE validators to document new incidents and identify regional trends in route
				hijacks. The tracking tool will have a user interface where users will be able to view data and generate
				simple customized graphs based on the parameters selected by the user (such as time range, countries to
				be compared, among other). This user interface will explain also how data is collated. Expected users
				will include IT management and policy decision makers, Internet Freedom activists and academics. The
				primary goal of both the report and tracking tool will be to expose intentional hijacks that infringe
				users security, privacy and free access to information in the Internet, drawing a link between core
				infrastructure and Internet Freedom. The report will be used as a key resource and promoted along the
				validator.</p>

			<h3 id="impactonpeoplelivinginoppressiveenvironments">Impact on people living in oppressive
				environments</h3>

			<p>RPKI deployment can help protect users in repressive environments not by preventing, but rather by
				exposing privacy breaches as well as censorship and surveillance attempts that rely on vulnerabilities
				of the routing system to operate. Specifically, the project will seek to give visibility to these abuses
				through the Routing Security and Internet Freedom report and tracking tool.</p>

			<p>When the Pakistan incident broke out, Computer Science Professor Steven M. Bellovin at Columbia
				University asked: “When is the pain from routing incidents great enough that we’re forced to act?”
				Improving the security of routing systems is a long overdue effort that needs to be tackled to render
				the Internet a safe and free environment for users, particularly those at risk of censorship and
				surveillance. Routing incidents are so frequent, that several attempts to curtail Internet Freedom and
				users privacy go unnoticed. The project expects to delve deeper into this problematic, particularly in
				the context of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

			<p>Why the project is needed and unique</p>

			<p>The project is needed and unique for four reasons:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><p>The project seeks to contribute to the consolidation of RPKI as a means to tackle routing
					security by developing an additional interoperable software for RPKI Validation to diversify
					alternatives available –beyond RIPE’s Validator which the only one fully functional today. This
					adheres to best practices for the development of Internet standards and infrastructure.</p>

					<p>Routing today is vulnerable to hijacking, and the use of digital certificates applied to routing
						information is the most effective solution devised to date to make traffic more secure.</p>

					<p>For RPKI to work, two things need to happen: first, those who have been assigned IP addresses
						must certify their resources obtaining a cryptographic key; and second, routing information (BGP
						routes) needs to be verified against the RPKI database or repository –hosted by a validator
						software– to determine its authenticity.</p>

					<p>Today, the only functioning validator upon which the whole RPKI technology depends is that of
						RIPE NCC. To ensure the resilience of Internet Infrastructure, it is a common standard to have
						at least two interoperable softwares, and the greater number of interoperable tools to support
						it, the more robust RPKI can become to secure routing.</p>

					<p>A recent bug found in RIPE’s validator in 2018 speaks of the risk of relying on a single tool.
						NAP Ecuador employed RIPE’s validator to verify routing information, and found that the session
						between the router and validator would crush, preventing the verification of valid routes. The
						bug was eventually attributed to a combination of somewhat obscure factors: the configuration of
						the CISCO Routers used by NAP Ecuador combined with the structure of the ROAs certificates
						issued by RIPE set off a coding error. While RIPE works with different iterations of the
						validator to ensure its robustness, the bug was found in all versions of the software.</p>

					<p>If RPKI is to take off as the primary mechanism to make routing more secure, it is important to
						develop additional validators.</p></li>

				<li><p>The project strives to push for further RPKI deployment in a region that shows great potential to
					make a qualitative leap forward in routing security as indicated by the percentage of operators who
					currently do resource certification.</p>

					<p>Latin America and the Caribbean is one of the leading regions in RPKI deployment with an
						estimated of 27% of operators having implemented Resource Verification.</p>

					<p>As shown by this extensive RPKI penetration to date, the region shows great potential to make a
						qualitative leap forward in RPKI adoption, rendering traffic more secure. For RPKI to
						effectively work, widespread adoption is needed and validators are key to ensure its proper
						functioning.</p>

					<p>This will in turn benefit citizens, journalist and activist from countries in the LAC region and
						beyond that face privacy threats and where information flows are being manipulated through
						techniques such as website blockages. In the short run, the project also expects to benefit
						end-users in the region by exposing privacy breaches as well as censorship and surveillance
						attempts that rely on vulnerabilities of the routing system to operate.</p></li>

				<li><p>The project encourages the involvement of the technical community in developing technical
					solutions to ensure Internet Freedom and promote civil society needs</p>

					<p>The most effective way for organizations from technical community to contribute Internet Freedom
						is precisely through the delivery of technical solutions that render the network a safer and
						secure tool for citizens worldwide.</p></li>

				<li><p>The project promotes the involvement of developers and technical community from the global south
					and encourage collaborations south-to-south as a means to tackle security gaps and render Internet
					more resilient to censorship threats.</p></li>
